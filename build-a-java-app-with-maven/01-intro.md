This tutorial shows you how to use Jenkins to orchestrate
building a simple Java application with
[Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).

If you are a Java developer who uses Maven and who is new to CI/CD concepts,
or you might be familiar with these concepts but don't know how to implement
building your application using Jenkins, then this tutorial is for you.

The simple Java application outputs the string "Hello world!"
and is accompanied by a couple of unit tests to check
that the main application works as expected.
The results of these tests are saved to a JUnit XML report.
