# Tutorial Sandbox Environment

The right part of the screen contains your sandbox environment.

This sandbox provides you the following tools:
* A web based IDE (top)
* A web based Terminal (bottom)
* A Jenkins LTS instance with Blue Ocean and Pipeline support
* A Git Server with the Java Demo Sample application



# Java Sample Application

The sample Java application outputs the string "Hello world!"
and is accompanied by a couple of unit tests to check
that the main application works as expected.
The results of these tests are saved to a JUnit XML report.

# Get The Java Sample Application Code

Obtain the simple "Hello world!" Java application using Git,
by cloning it on the sandbox environment from the Git Server.

Execute the following command on the web based Terminal on your right.
You can also click on

`git clone https://butler:butler@[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-3000-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/butler/simple-java-maven-app`{{execute}}
