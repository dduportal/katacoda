This tutorial shows you how to use Jenkins to orchestrate building a simple Java
application with https://maven.apache.org/[Maven].

If you are a Java developer who uses Maven and who is new to CI/CD concepts, or
you might be familiar with these concepts but don't know how to implement
building your application using Jenkins, then this tutorial is for you.

The simple Java application (which you'll obtain from a sample repository on
GitHub) outputs the string "Hello world!" and is accompanied by a couple of unit
tests to check that the main application works as expected. The results of these
tests are saved to a JUnit XML report.
